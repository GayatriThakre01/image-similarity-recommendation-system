# 🖼️ Image Similarity-Based Product Recommendation

This project recommends visually similar products using **deep learning**. A pretrained **ResNet-18 CNN** is used to extract image features, and **cosine similarity** is applied to find and rank similar images.

## Objective
- Extract deep visual features from images
- Measure similarity using cosine similarity
- Recommend top similar products

## Technologies
Python, PyTorch, ResNet-18, Scikit-learn, Gradio

## Output
- Upload an image
- Get visually similar product recommendations
